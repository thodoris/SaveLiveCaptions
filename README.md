###  Features

---
- ✨Save live captions to a text file.
- 😃Minimalist floating dashboard.
- **😎Customizable save options. (save location and quality option in `config.py`)**

###  Installation
### Option 1: Quick Start (Executable)
You can download the latest version from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note on Antivirus Alerts:** If you encounter a malware warning for the `.exe` file, it is likely a **false positive** due to the lack of a digital signature. If you worry about this, try option 2 as follows. 

### Option 2: Run from Source (Recommended for Security)
If you prefer to run the code directly, follow these steps in your bash/PowerShell/cmd:

1. **Clone this repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LiveCaptionsHelper/SaveLiveCaptions.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the tool**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
   > **Good News, You can now edit the `src/function/config.py` to modify the quality of saving on your own.**

### Background Hotkeys

For daily use, run `StartSaveLiveCaptions.vbs` once. It starts
`HotkeyLauncher.pyw` without opening a terminal.

- **Win + Alt + C** starts Live Captions and recording.
- **Win + Alt + X** stops recording, saves the file, closes Live Captions, and
   exits the controller.

Repeated start presses are ignored while a recording workflow is running. The
launcher appends troubleshooting messages to `HotkeyLauncher.log`.

### Guidelines

---

1. Before you open this application, make sure you already **open the live captions on Windows** (or it will exit automatically). Then double click the `SaveLiveCaptions.exe`. A small dashboard will appear in the top-left corner of your screen. You can drag the background to move this window.

2. The **● (Circle)**  button is "start to save captions" and the **■ (Square)** button is "stop and exit the application". 

3. **Start saving:** When you click the circle button, a file dialog will open to choose a save location. If you don't choose the direction, the default location is `~/Documents/captions`. 

4. **Stop and exit:** When you click the square button, it stops and exit the application. You can find your captions file `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_captions.txt` in the chosen location like following.
